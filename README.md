# Biopython_Alignments

Created as a teaching assistant for the WISc 1000 course. Aimed to give students a look into ways to combine the principles of computing 
and biology that they are learning.


Involves performing sequence alignments on fasta dna sequences, a blast of a sequence that was studied, and then finding a new
sequence using genbank and performing another alignment to display the change when aligning highly related sequences.
